# impact-fac

Estimating the "impact" of the Journal of Experimental Biology (JEB) for the year 2018.

For the year 2018, we calculate the impact factor for [JEB](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=journal+of+experimental+biology&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) and discuss whether it is a good descriptor of the distribution of the number of citations.

Submitted as an assignment for [Raghav Rajan's](https://raghavrajan.wixsite.com/rajanlab) Biostatistics course at IISER Pune.
